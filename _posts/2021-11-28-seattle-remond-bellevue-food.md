With just 3-hour drive from where we live, my family went to Seattle a lot. Nowadays, we do not visit the tourist spots anymore. Our target is the food, Asian food specifically. This post is about our 3-day food tour around Thanksgiving.

**Watch out!** Washington King county imposes covid-19 vaccine mandate. As of Oct 25, the county requires people 12 and older to verify they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to dine in at restaurants.

## Where we stayed

We stayed at [Element Seattle Redmond](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/seare-element-seattle-redmond/) (15220 NE Shen St, Redmond, WA 98052). This hotel is close to most of the restaurants we want to visit. The room (we usually stayed at) has 2 queen beds, 1 sofa, 1 desk, 1 decent-sized refrigerator, and a well-equipped-enough kitchen. The breakfast is included. However, on-site parking costs extra.

## Day 1's coffee

![Lighthouse Roasters](/assets/images/seattle/lighthouse-roasters-11-2021.jpg){: .align-right}
We started driving at 8:10 am, and arrived at Seattle at 11:00 am. Before lunch, we stopped at [Lighthouse Roasters](https://lighthouseroasters.com/) (400 N 43rd St, Seattle, WA 98103). We love the coffee here and have been visiting this place every time we visited Seattle. Due to Covid-19, it is take-out-only. This place is a bit pricy though. When we want to treat ourselves, we will also buy some beans so that we can make our own latte back at home. 

This is at Fremont and close to University of Washington. One can also walk around Fremont or University of Washington and stop by for coffee.

Eater Seattle has an article, [11 SMALL BATCH ROASTERS EVERY SEATTLEITE SHOULD KNOW](https://seattle.eater.com/22532851/best-seattle-coffee-roasters-small-batch), and Lighthouse Roasters is mentioned in the article.

## Day 1's lunch

We had our lunch at [Looking For Chai Edmonds (找茶)](https://www.facebook.com/lookingforchai/) (22511 Hwy 99 Suite 100, Edmonds, WA 98026).  This is the only restaurant we want to visit not close to our hotel; thus, we decided to knock this one down first. The location is in the same shopping plaza as "99 ranch market". We walked around in the market while waiting for the restaurant to open.

They serve some extra Taiwanese dishes as Weekend Specials. Too bad that we did not visit during the weekend this time.

</figure>

"Looking For Chai" is a good place for some Taiwanese food and tea. Yi Fang's tea is carried here. We like Yi Fang's tea. We usually order our tea with 30% ice and 30% sugar. The above are what we ordered this time. They are all pretty good. There are quite some real passion fruit and real guava in those drinks.

We have "Yi Fang" near where we live. Even though we like it, we seldom buy those drinks due to dietary choice. Being in the travel mode, we decided to indulge ourselves.

</figure>

We ordered the dishes shown in the figures above. 
- "Water Spinach With Garlic 蒜蓉空心菜" is beyond our expectation. It came with huge quantity and with a lot of garlic. With our small stove at home, we cannot stir-fry vegetable like this.
- "Pork Intestine with Vermicelli 大腸麵線" is on par with what we can get at Taiwan.
- "Fried Stinky Tofu 炸臭豆腐" is fried very well. It is also stinky enough. When we visited last time, the stinky tofu was not stinky enough and just tasted like normal tofu.
- "Oyster Pancake 蚵仔煎" is among the best oyster pancakes we have tried near Seattle.

## Day 1's afternoon snack

After lunch, we checked in at the hotel and rested a little bit. Then we went to [Meet Fresh Bellevue 鮮芋仙](https://www.meetfresh.us/) (15552 Lake Hills Blvd, Suite F5, Bellevue, WA 98007).

I like "grass jelly 仙草" and my wife likes "taro ball 芋圓", so this is our go-to dessert place. They serve shaved ice, hot drinks, and some regular tea drinks also.

"Matcha shaved ice 抹茶冰" has strong matcha flavor. Originally, it tasted very good. After a while, the flavor was a bit too strong and overwhelming. If you like matcha a lot, you will like this one.

We added a lot of extra ingredients into our shaved ice, including taro balls 芋圓, taro 芋頭, pudding 布丁, black sugar boba 黑糖珍珠, barley 薏仁, and grass jelly 仙草. We found out later that we were too ambitious. We should just order 1 shaved ice instead of 2. We will try to remember this next time.

We ordered bubble waffle also. My family like bubble waffle at Meet Fresh more than the one at Happy Lemon.

## Day 1's dinner

We had the dinner at 7 pm at [Dough Zone Dumpling House at Overlake 麵貼面](https://www.doughzonedumplinghouse.com/) (14625 NE 24th St #4b, Bellevue, WA 98007).
