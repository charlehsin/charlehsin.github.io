[Little Griddle](https://littlegriddlecafe.com/) is a brunch spot of Beaumont neighborhood in Portland, Oregon. It has been serving the neighborhood since 2017. My family has never visited this cafe before. This morning, we drove our son to attend a Christmas concert around Beaumont. While waiting, we were searching for a good weekend brunch place. We found that Little Griddle has many good reviews and we decided to give it a try. We did not regret!!

This is a small, cozy cafe, and the seats are limited. We arrived at 9:15 am and we were seated right away. All seats were taken at around 9:30 am. Thus, I will suggest to visit before 9 am.

They serve benedicts, skillets, sandwiches, sweet dishes, and drinks. You can find the full menu at their website. We first ordered coffee ($3), which is refillable. The coffee was fresh and strong. We liked the coffee. My wife ordered the country benedict ($14), and I ordered the bacon and spinach skillet ($16).

The country benedict came with collard greens, Hollandaise, poached egg, braised chicken, and house biscuit. My wife loved it. The vinegar taste in the collard greens is very unique. We liked that it includes the braised chicken, not the fried chicken as in many other brunch places.  My wife subbed the salad with fruits ($1 extra). The fruits tasted fresh also.

The bacon and spinach skillet came with bacon, melted leeks, garlic, spinach, two baked eggs, all in cheddar-Parmesan cream sauce, and a Panko crust. I enjoyed this dish a lot. The included side salad also tasted very good.

Overall, this is a place which we will definitely visit again.
