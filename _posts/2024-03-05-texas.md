My family never visited Texas before. Therefore, in spring break 2024, we spent 9 days visiting San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth, and Dallas.

## Day 1 (Tuesday): Portland to Austin to San Antonio

Our Alaska flight arrived at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in the evening. Then we drove to our hotel, Hyatt Place San Antonio-North/Stone Oak. The drive took about 1.5 hours.

## Day 2 (Wednesday): San Antonio - Natural Bridge Caverns and River walk

In the morning, we checked out from the hotel and drove to our 10 am [Natural Bridge Caverns - Discovery Tour](https://naturalbridgecaverns.com/discoverytour/). The hotel and the Natural Bridge Caverns are both at the north of San Antonio. Natural Bridge Caverns has several different tours. Since this is our first time, we choose the classic discovery tour.
